# 0x07. C - Recursion
## Description
Project about the usage of recursion in the creation of functions.
## Objectives
- What is recursion
- How to implement recursion
- In what situations you should implement recursion
- In what situations you shouldn’t implement recursion.
## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
- Files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- Not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden
- Allowed to use _putchar.
- The prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in header file called holberton.h
- Don’t forget to push header file
- Not allowed to use any kind of loops
- Not allowed to use static variables
## Tasks
0. She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget: function that prints a string, followed by a new line.
1. Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together: function that prints a string in reverse.
2. Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange: function that returns the length of a string.
3. You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling: function that returns the factorial of a given number.
4. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate:  function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.
5. Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer: function that returns the natural square root of a number.
6. Inception. Is it possible?: function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.
7. They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything: function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.
