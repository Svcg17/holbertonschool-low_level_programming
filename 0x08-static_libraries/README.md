# 0x08. C - Static libraries
## Description
This project contains assignments that have to do with C static libraries.
## Objectives
- What is a static library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it
- Basic usage of ar, ranlib, nm
## Requirements for C scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
- All files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- Not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden
- Are allowed to use _putchar
- The prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in header file called holberton.h
- Don’t forget to push header file
## Bash Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- All files should end with a new line (why?)
- The first line of all files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, describing what each script is doing
- All files must be executable
## Tasks
0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life: Create the static library libholberton.a containing all the functions listed.
1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future : Create a script called create_static_lib.sh that creates a static library called liball.a from all the .c files that are in the current directory.
2. Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing: Write a blog post on C static libraries.
