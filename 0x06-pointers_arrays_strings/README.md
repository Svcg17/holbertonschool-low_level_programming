# 0x06. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings
## Description
- This project is about a more complex implementation of pointers, arrays and strings in the making of functions in C language.
## Objectives
- What are pointers to pointers and how to use them
- What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them
- What are the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings
## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
- All files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- Not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etcâ€¦ is forbidden
- Allowed to use _putchar
## Tasks
- 0. memset: function that fills memory with a constant byte. 
- 1. memcpy: function that copies memory area.
- 2. strchr: function that locates a character in a string.
- 3. strspn: function that gets the length of a prefix substring.
- 4. strpbrk: function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.
- 5. strstr: function that locates a substring.
- 6. Chess is mental torture:  function that prints the chessboard.
- 7. The line of life is a ragged diagonal between duty and desire: function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.
- 8. Double pointer, double fun: function that sets the value of a pointer to a char.
