## Description
C Project about command line arguments used in primary main function: argc and argv.
## Objectives
- How to use arguments passed to your program
- What are two prototypes of main that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
- How to use __attribute__((unused)) or (void) to compile functions with unused variables or parameters
## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
- All files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- Not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in the header file called holberton.h
- Donâ€™t forget to push the header file

## Tasks
0. It ain't what they call you, it's what you answer to: 0. It ain't what they call you, it's what you answer to 
1. Silence is argument carried out by other means: Write a program that prints the number of arguments passed into it.
2. The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter: Write a program that prints all arguments it receives
3. Neither irony nor sarcasm is argument: Write a program that multiplies two numbers.
4. To infinity and beyond: Write a program that adds positive numbers.
